# Opportunity Hack - Team 14
### Non-Profit Organization: National Kidney Foundation of Arizona

## Problem Statement

The National Kidney Foundation of Arizona needs a batter way to manage customer applications forms. Currently they fill them out on paper and fax them to an employee for manual data entry into a CSV file, which is used to import data into their database.

## Getting Started

Our web forms run on a web server using Flask. To start up the web server, simply use python to run 'app.py.'

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* Flask v0.12.2
* Flask-Compress

### Installing

On macOS or Linux systems, install Python 3 and pip3, then install flask and flask-compress using Terminal with the following command:
```
$ pip3 install flask
$ pip3 install flask-compress
```
Then, cd into the directory that contains the project and execute the app file with the following command:
```
$ python3 app.py
```
## Deployment

Our system is currently deployed on an Ubuntu server hosted by Digital Ocean; however, our flask application can easily be deployed on a variety of different systems.
